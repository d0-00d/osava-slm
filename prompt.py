"""
The prompt, the severity scale, and the bucketing -- in one place.

This module exists because of a bug worth remembering. `run_eval.py` used to
carry two prompt variants named `round2` and `strict` that differed by a
single trailing full stop, so every "shipped vs strict" comparison compared a
prompt against itself and reported the difference as noise. A prompt that is
defined twice will eventually be defined differently.

Training and evaluation MUST agree on this text exactly. A fine-tune learns
P(severity | prompt + event); scoring it under a different prompt measures
something else and there is no warning when it happens.

#   the date makes the prompt non-reproducible -- the exact string fed to the
