"""
Emit the classifier contract as one machine-readable artefact.

    python3 export_contract.py --out contract.json

The problem this solves: the contract is authored in Python (prompt.py,
contract.py, indicators.py) and consumed in TypeScript (HIRA). Every shared
fact -- the input field order, the severity scale, the bucketing, the
escalation rule, the output schema -- was independently restated on the
TypeScript side, and the restatements had already drifted:

  * HIRA's VALID_SEVERITIES still carried `critical`, dropped from this tier
    on evidence (R5).
  * parseClassification() required `confidence`, removed by R7, so every
    response failed validation and fell back to "benign".
  * promptBuilder's few-shot examples demonstrate the pre-R4 seven-field
    schema with severity fourth, contradicting what the model was trained on.

A contract that is restated is a contract that drifts. This file is the only
place it is written down; HIRA reads the JSON and checks `prompt_sha256`
against the deployed Modelfile at startup, so drift fails loudly instead of
silently degrading classification.
